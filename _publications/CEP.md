This study analyzes the impact of public housing on adjacent neighborhoods, focusing on their consumption levels and the population share of individuals aged 20â€“59 years. Using administrative data on public housing and credit card usage data with detailed geography, we examine the heterogeneous effects of two types of public housing: buy-to-rent and build-to-rent. Buy-to-rent housing exhibits no significant effects on neighborhoods within its 500-m radius. In contrast, build-to-rent housing reduces the consumption level by 1.9% and the share of the working-age population by 0.3 percentage points. The negative effects increase as the neighborhood's proximity to public housing increases.
